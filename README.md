## File Extension Validator

This is a js module that will validate file types that you feed it. I'm creating it to validate image file types for a node app, but you should be able to use it for whatever.


### How it works
You feed the contructor a string of the filename and an array of file extensions you wish to validate on. Right now I'm using indexOf so it won't support < IE9.
